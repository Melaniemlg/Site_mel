In the summer of 1942, Sonia is passionately enjoying the countryside. 
But it is not easy to be twelve years old when you have red hair, when you are undisciplined and that a war is on...


*This novel evokes the childhood of Sonia Rykiel, a whimsical and free woman who invented the concept of "demode".*        
*It is followed by a Q&A biography and an illustrated primer, to tell the story of over forty years of creation in images.*
