July 1885. Hit by a violent fever, Edouard Darcy dies on his return from Africa.   
Driven by the promise she had made to him shortly before, and seeking to escape from an arranged marriage,   
his 17-year-old daughter Anna decides to follow in his footsteps.    
She intends to be the first one to discover the civilization he has told her so much about:    
the Pygmies living on the banks of the River Ogooué.    
Through her adventures, she will learn more about Africa, human nature and herself...   


*To create Anna, Ève-Marie Lobriaut was inspired by the life of Marie Kingsley, a female explorator*   
*of the 19th century who was the first European adventurer to explore the unknown lands of Gabon*.
