What could have driven the giraffe Ramona, a wise resident of the town zoo, to eat up a lion?   
Were the acacia leaves not enough to satisfy her?
"It was an accident!" she stammers to the compassionate Commissioner Pillière.
"A murder!" roar the widow of the dead beast in front of the implacable Deputy Dentu.
What if it was ultimately a crime of passion?
Not bad. But that does not explain everything...


*In this short detective novel, love will not triumph any better than in Romeo and Juliet*.   
*But, as always, it is from the genius of children that the light will shine.*
