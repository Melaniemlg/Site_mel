A sudden arrival in 1789, a woman from theatre who offers her to go on stage, a trip to Paris, everything is rushing for the teenager who has had to leave her loved ones again. Will she succeed in interpreting the signs that mark out her journey through time, as she goes through the events of history with the help of great figures such as Olympe de Gouges and Abbot Grégoire?   



*Her incredible odissey journey will give us a glimpse on our historical, cultural and religious history.*
*This is the fourth book of a series of 5 novels, which chronicles thirteen-year-old Mona’s quest of origins and revisits the key moments of our History and artistic creation.*
