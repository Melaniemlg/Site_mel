With her boyish cut, Adrienne is a young woman who likes to party with her friends.   
But she’s nearly 24 years old now, and she wonders what she is going to do with her life.   
Getting married, no way! Working in an office neither. All that she wants is to be as free as a bird.   

**April 1921**. 
Outbreak of joy in the streets of Santiago de Chile and Buenos Aires.   
While no one believed this feat even possible, the French aviatrix Adrienne Bolland, unknown until then, just passed the Andes mountain range aboard her plane, where many experienced pilots have lost their lives.
