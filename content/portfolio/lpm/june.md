**June 1944**.   
Jude is about to disembark with the Rangers at Pointe du Hoc. 
In the barge that is taking on water, in the heart of the night and the cold, it is anxiety that prevails. 
Clutching his camera, the young reporter wants to believe in his mission: to bring back pictures to testify to the extraordinary courage of those around him.

**November 1940**. 
For her fourteenth birthday, June receives a Leica from her grandfather. While the Blitz is raging, this gift, like her meeting with the war photographer Robert Capa, will change her destiny.
