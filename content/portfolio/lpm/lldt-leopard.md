Mona doesn’t know where she comes from and lives with her foster father. 
On her 13th birthday, she uncovers a painting in her family’s library and finds herself carried away in Middle Age. 
She will be taken care of by Master Isaac and his Apprentice Colin and introduced to the cornerstones of artistic expression.
But everything she builds will be challenged by her encounter with Alienor of Aquitaine, on her way to the Second Crusades. In this turbulent and hostile environment, Mona will have to find out how to return to her previous life.   



*Her incredible odissey journey will give us a glimpse on our historical, cultural and religious history.*
*This is the first book of a series of 5 novels, which chronicles thirteen-year-old Mona’s quest of origins and revisits the key moments of our History and artistic creation.*
