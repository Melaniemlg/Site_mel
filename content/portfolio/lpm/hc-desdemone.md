***A historical novel for children about theatre and actors in the 17th century London.***


Since women are not allowed to become actors, **Esther** has to disguise herself as a man to perform:
to everyone she is Samuel Garland, the great London actor. Her daughter **Abra** and her friend **John**, 
both ten years old, are passionate about theatre. 
While he dreams of becoming an actor, she dreams of writing plays, but that too is for *gentleman only*… 
However, despite these obstacles, they are ready to go as far as they can to achieve their plans, 
not foreseeing that a fatal blow will affect not only the theatre, but also their destiny.       



**Short-listed for Prix collégiens lecteurs de Gironde 2022.**
