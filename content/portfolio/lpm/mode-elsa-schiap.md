At ten years old, Elsa is terribly bored.
In the Rome of the early 20th century, the mischievous little girl is going to give her
entourage a run for their money and assert her temperament!


*This book evokes the extraordinary personality of Elsa Schiaparelli, who brought a wind of madness to the fashion world of the 1930s.*           
*It is followed by a Q&A biography and an illustrated primer, to tell the story of over forty years of creation in images.*
