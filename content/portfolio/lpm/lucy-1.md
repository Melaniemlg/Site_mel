Lucy is a typical thirteen year old girl with acne. She has two best friends with whom she shares her deepest secrets and laughter. Between high school and family however, her daily life is a bore. Luckily, her theatre/drama class each Wednesday brightens up her week, for this is where she gets to see the handsome Adrian. But how can she ever get him to notice her? As luck would have it, a new after school theatre workshop gives her the opportunity she’s been waiting for. Sadly though, due to her family’s financial situation she cannot afford to go. Not to be defeated by such trifles, our little intrepid heroine will use all her cunning and street smarts to realise her dream. She takes a job as a babysitter and dog walker, getting into all sorts of mischief, which paves the way for an unexpected ending.
