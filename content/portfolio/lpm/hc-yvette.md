In 1927, inspired by a performance of the Swedish Ballet, Yvette – at the age of ten – takes the entrance exam 
for the National Opera of Paris. Despite the rivalries and mockery, she can count on her friends and her talent to reveal 
the great dancer in her.
Fourteen years later, after her performance in the ballet *Istar*, Yvette Chauviré is elevated to the rank
of prima ballerina. She has finally achieved her goal, making her mother Berthe proud.   

*This short novel describes the history of one of the greatest ballet dancer in France, while revealing the backstage of the* 
*Paris Opera.*
*It is followed by a glossary.*
