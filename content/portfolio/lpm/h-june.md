**In 1940**, for her fourteenth birthday, June receives a
Leica from her grandfather. While the Blitz is raging,
this gift, like her meeting with the war photographer
Robert Capa, will change her destiny.

**In 1944**, June now known as Jude is about to
disembark with the Rangers at Pointe du Hoc. In the
barge that is taking on water, in the heart of the night
and the cold, anxiety prevails. Clutching her camera,
the young reporter wants to believe in her mission:
bring back pictures to testify the extraordinary courage
of those around her.
