Hearing her father and his companions talk about their expeditions, ***Freyja*** is eager to explore
these unknown and mysterious worlds. When the opportunity arises, the young Viking does not
hesitate. 
From Ribe to Jutland, she boards the Freyjaskip and heads west: Dorestad, Her Island, Nantes...        
During her journey, which takes her to the coast of Aquitaine in France, she gradually
discovers her powers, making her Litil Völva: the little prophetess.
*But why Aquitaine?*        
*What deal have the Vikings made with King Pepin II, who is waiting for them there?*
