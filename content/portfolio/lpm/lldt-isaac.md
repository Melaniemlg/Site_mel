When Mona returns from the Middle Ages, she finds Max, the man who raised her, and her life as a middle grade student. 
But how this time travel may had happen? What meaning should she give it? What happened to her friends Isaac and Colin, who disappeared so suddenly? These haunting questions will take her from the busy streets of New York to the schoolhouse in Nancy at the dawn of the 20th century.   
With her uncommon ability to blend into her environment, Mona will cross the destiny of the Avigdor family and go through the transformations of a new era: that of industrialization, photography, the beginnings of cinema and Modern Style embodied by one of the great French geniuses, Emile Gallé...   



*Her incredible odissey journey will give us a glimpse on our historical, cultural and religious history.*
*This is the second book of a series of 5 novels, which chronicles thirteen-year-old Mona’s quest of origins and revisits the key moments of our History and artistic creation.*
