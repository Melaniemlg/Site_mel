Mona begins 8th grade. She is happy to see her foster father, but she never felt more offset. How could she be an ordinary girl when she is able to time travel and when four of her best friends are trapped in the past?
The jewels from her suitcase have not delivered all their secrets and the hexagonal ring is obsessing her more than anything else…    



*Her incredible odissey journey will give us a glimpse on our historical, cultural and religious history.*
*This is the third book of a series of 5 novels, which chronicles thirteen-year-old Mona’s quest of origins and revisits the key moments of our History and artistic creation.*
