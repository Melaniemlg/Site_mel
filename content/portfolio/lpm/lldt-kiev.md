*"They sit across each other in the train that bring them back to Paris. Maxime cannot help but look at his daughter. She is no longer the one he left for a simple phone call in a Nancy library office. Her face is emaciated and you can see the torments he did not experience on it. He would like to take her in his arms, say to her he will always be her dad and that he wished he would have been there for her. He does not dare. How to act towards what is happening to her and what is eating away at her?   
Mona perceives Maxime's look on her but keeps her eyes closed. She wish she could alleviate his fears without knowing how to do so. Their helplessness to face the enigma of her destiny is so intense that it is scaring her."*      
    



It is in 1941, in this fifth and final book that Mona will finally find all the answers.
