Margot has made a promise to herself: "To be who I am, to follow my path, whatever the cost."   
As she goes to isolate herself in the Basque mountains to turn over a new leaf in her life, she meets Argia, a young shepherdess just starting out, whose 842 ewes make her crazy.   
A first laugh springs from a cow dung. A friendship develops around the life of the herd. And the day after a party in the summer pastures, Margot offers Argia to join her Team Raffut, a secret group with great ambitions in the world of rugby.   
But hush! Nothing must be leaked, otherwise everything will be ruined.


*A story about gender equality, rugby, fresh air... and sheep*.
