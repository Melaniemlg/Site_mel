Valentin is ten years old when he starts in a new school. On a wall of his classroom is a reproduction of Matisse's collage “Icarus”. Valentin will do the same as Icarus, he will fly. Valentin will do better than Icarus, he will fly far away, very far away. He knows it. Well, not always. Sometimes he also thinks he's the lamest boy around.   




*The Psy Season collection deals with daily interrogations teenagers face. Each book offers a double approach: first as a fiction and second as a documentary. All the titles form a whole like episodes from a TV show.*
