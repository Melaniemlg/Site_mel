**Help, I've been trough a trauma!**

**Allan**, a 9-year-old boy is spending the summer with his grandmother. 
While everything seems peaceful, he suddenly stops talking and begins to become the target of bullies at school. 
When he meets **Serge**, the grumpy gardener who takes care of him during community service, everything slowly gets better. During his apprenticeship as a landscape gardener, he meets **Asma** who will finally help him talk about his trauma.   





*The Psy Season collection deals with daily interrogations teenagers face. Each book offers a double approach: first as a fiction and second as a documentary. All the titles form a whole like episodes from a TV show.*
