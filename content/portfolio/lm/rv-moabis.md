***An ecological adventure novel in the heart of Congo.***


Mobou is a ten-year-old Baka Pygmy. 
He lives with his family in a camp located in the heart of the Congo basin. 
Mobou loves to hunt. The mysterious forest teeming with life is his favorite playground and the Gambian rat his favorite prey.
One day, the little people of the forest hosts an official from Kinshasa: the government has just sold a portion of their 
territory to foreign loggers. 
The Pygmies are ordered to move... into concrete huts.
So, with his family and a couple of researchers from an NGO, Mobou sets up a whole arsenal of defense.
His goal: to force the tree killers to leave the forest.
