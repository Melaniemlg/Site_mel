**Help, I need assistance!**

Tara is not well.
Ines, her friend, is doing her best to help her but she is confronted with a silence she cannot explain.
Thanks to Adam — nicknamed Paradise by the students — who is a high school supervisor, Tara will be able to understand
that she is ill and that her illness will divert her path.
But also, that not all paths are similar and sometimes you have to take other roads to be joyful again. 





*The Psy Season collection deals with daily interrogations teenagers face. Each book offers a double approach: first as a fiction and second as a documentary. All the titles form a whole like episodes from a TV show.*
