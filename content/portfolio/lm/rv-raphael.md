***Unloved, Raphaël manipulates his friends until a dramatic event occurs...***


In the small village of Saint-Laure where everybody knows each other, **Raphaël** does his best to be hated. 
Mean, arrogant, sometimes cruel: that is the image he projects and the reputation he has built for himself. 
**Louis** and **Lili**, his two best friends, are never able to reason with him and his mischief multiplies, 
pushing the inhabitants to their limits.
However, one day, the joke turns into a drama.
How far will Raphaël go to manipulate his friends?
Why does he seems to go out of his way to get his parents’ attention?
