***An endearing feel-good book that will bring your smile back!***


Gaspard is a responsible boy. 
He is even too responsible for his own parents who are… disorganized and messy, sarcastic and squabbling, 
absurd and eccentric, surprising and extravagant, unconventional and jokers. 
But Gaspard won’t give up on that: he has to take care of the family.
Otherwise, who will?   
And he‘s doing a great job, a pretty great job! Until the day he accidentally makes the beautiful Nina cry. 
So, Gaspard decides to do everything he can to bring Nina's smile back, even if it means dropping his perfect child act... 
Or not.
