***A strong and endearing novel to question our relationships with the wild world.***


2035. A terrible virus spreads and forces the population to lockdown.
Ombeline is bored in the orphanage where she lives in. 
Thankfully, she can count on four-year-old Leontine and fourteen-year-old Malaurie, 
who are like sisters to her, to brighten up her day. 
The only adult who looks after her, Jacinthe, knows her secret: Ombeline can communicate with animals.
She does not speak to them: she emits a slight breath, catches their gaze and begins to communicate.

Her life is turned upside down when she finds out that a white tiger has escaped from the zoo.
*Will she be able to communicate with such an animal?*



*Staying Alive is a collection of novels and short stories that portrays our modern world.*
*The books within are addressing ecological, social and ethical issues towards pre-teens to young adults.*
