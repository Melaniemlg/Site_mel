***What if a simple envelope could change your life?...***


Red envelopes. That is what some teenagers found one day in their belongings. 
How did they get there? Who wrote them? 
Why are they always addressed "to the one I hate"?
The faces and personalities of the recipients have one thing in common: an immense anger that consumes them. 
Soon, the only solution seems to be writing, freedom and the possibility of being part of something bigger. 
A big project, a big goal, a big novel that could spread courage and energy to readers of this generation.

*A new generation, indeed,... but will it be better than the last?*
         



*Staying Alive is a collection of novels and short stories that portrays our modern world.*
*The books within are addressing ecological, social and ethical issues towards pre-teens to young adults.*
