***An exhilarating and optimistic novel about a teenager's revolt in the face of injustice.***


Badri, a sixteen-year-old Georgian, is passionate about rugby.
But if he has ended up in Lourdes, it is not for the beauty of landscape or sport, 
but because his parents are refugees.
After a journey through Europe, they find themselves in this small town, 
waiting for a hypothetical regularisation... or eviction.
It is this risk that pushes Margot, where Badri is staying at, to take him on a runaway, 
as the former refugees used to do through the Pyrenean mountains. 
As they meet and spend time together, their almost brotherly friendship turns into tenderness.
Even if the schoolgirl remains focused on her goal: saving Badri from injustice.
