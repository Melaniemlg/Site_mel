***A race against death on the slopes of the Pyrenean peaks.***


A young constable chasing a prison escapee discovers a corpse near a mountain shelter. 
The victim is underage, there are a few clues, but witnesses accuse a fugitive. 
At the same time, parents report the disappearance of their fourteen-year-old son. 
This is all the more worrying as the knife plunged into the corpse could belong to the teenager.

*What happened?* 
*What if this was not the murderer’s first attempt?*

The clock is ticking and a race against death begins…
     


         


*Staying Alive is a collection of novels and short stories that portrays our modern world.*
*The books within are addressing ecological, social and ethical issues towards pre-teens to young adults.*
