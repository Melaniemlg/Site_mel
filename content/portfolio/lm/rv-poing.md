Junior is a middle school student in eighth grade. Their French teacher asked them to write the documented biography of a person who tried to change the world. Consequently to George Floyd's death and the many anti-racist protests that followed around the world, the young man chooses to write about the life of Tommie Smith, an African-American athlete who distinguished himself raising a black-gloved fist at the Olympic games of 1968.

*This novel, deeply embedded in a hot topic, is set in a very uncommon time frame : during a lockdown, virtual lessons, away* *from school and its obligations, the discovery of neighbours… and maybe love.*
