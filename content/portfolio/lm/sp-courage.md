**Help, I live in a cage!**

**Thomas** is sitting in front of his music therapist’s piano.
Everything could go on normally, if not for the imposed presence of Thomas’ mother during the sessions.
The atmosphere is heavy, the uneasiness settles in to the point that even Pom the cat cannot stand the presence of
this woman.
But Thomas finds a way to give clues to his therapist evenunder his mother’s watch…   





*The Psy Season collection deals with daily interrogations teenagers face. Each book offers a double approach: first as a fiction and second as a documentary. All the titles form a whole like episodes from a TV show.*
