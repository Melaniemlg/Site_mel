**Help, we have a borderline personality disorder!**

Julien and Aude only cross paths with each other at the shrink's, but they have a secret: a hiding place where each of them leaves a letter for the other, before or after their weekly session. It was Aude who started the game. A game of confidences to a stranger in a waiting room. A game of mirrors in which they become each other's reflection. Borderline together but alone in their own world.    





*The Psy Season collection deals with daily interrogations teenagers face. Each book offers a double approach: first as a fiction and second as a documentary. All the titles form a whole like episodes from a TV show.*
