**Help, I’m a screen addict!**

Manon, Clément and Enzo are teenagers.
Manon is chomping at the bit to become a game designer.
Enzo is addicted to network and puzzle games and his social discomfort causes him to identify with his avatars.
Clement, whose childhood dog has just died, is seeking friendship among social network users.   





*The Psy Season collection deals with daily interrogations teenagers face. Each book offers a double approach: first as a fiction and second as a documentary. All the titles form a whole like episodes from a TV show.*
