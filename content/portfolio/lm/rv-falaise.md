***What would you do if you discovered your mother was abused as a child?***


*"I see exactly the scene in slow-motion.*

*My dad creases the pages, lets them fall on the ground and says ‘Gee whiz!’*
*At that moment, I don’t suspect anything."*    

Fifteen-year-old Charlotte discovers that her mother was abused as a child. As her love for Pablo awakens her desire, she will have to face the wave that is hitting her family. She will discover the abjection of which adults are capable of: some knew and said nothing. Between rage and tenderness, Charlotte will have to find her own way...
