**Here come the Aspie girls!**

Everyone has always described Alice as a high-potential teenager but never admitted the depth of her discomfort and her true Asperger’s syndrome. Moving and changing middle schools will disturb her and bring out her odd personality. Her admiration for Fanny, the most popular girl, and her desire to be just like her in order to be loved, will blow her world apart and put her at risk.  




*The Psy Season collection deals with daily interrogations teenagers face. Each book offers a double approach: first as a fiction and second as a documentary. All the titles form a whole like episodes from a TV show.*
