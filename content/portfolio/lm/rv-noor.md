*Ten years of war seen by the eyes of the young Syrian generation...*

Since the first protests by exiled high school students in camps near the Turkish border,
Noor has a front row seat to the Syrian revolution and its gradual slide into civil war.
What was originally a dream for her and her friends is now vital:
**witness, report, and tell the world what is happening in their country**,
with the only weapon they have: their smartphones.
