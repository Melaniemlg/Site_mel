***The hard living of a fourteen-year-old prostitute.***


**Jasmina** is a fourteen-year-old Nigerian girl. 
In exchange for money, her father agrees to entrust her to two strangers who promise to give her a job and a happy life.
Reality lies elsewhere. 
Jasmina has to comply with their demands and is forced to sell her body. 
Only the friendship of her fellows of misery – **Saïda**, **Fatima** and **Karim** – helps her in this horrible world.
But when Jasmina gets pregnant, her two jailers become strangely caring. 

*Is this child the key to escape from hell? That is what Jasmina hopes...*

         



*Staying Alive is a collection of novels and short stories that portrays our modern world.*
*The books within are addressing ecological, social and ethical issues towards pre-teens to young adults.*
