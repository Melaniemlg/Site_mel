Marie-Bénédicte, a twelve-year-old girl, receives for her birthday a computer to which she is going to reveal her terrible 
secret: it has been five months that every Wednesday afternoon, her uncle Laurent – her mother's younger brother with whom 
she used to spend such beautiful vacations as a child – sexually abuses her. 
She writes about her uneasiness, her suffering, her feeling of guilt, her discouragement facing her relatives and friends who 
cannot or will not see anything.
But how could she break the silence?
