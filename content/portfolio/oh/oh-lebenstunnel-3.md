**Book 3: Penance**     

In the Niederhagen camp, where traitors to the nation are deported, only one motto prevails: 
"A generation of stronger will eliminate the weaker. To do penance is to sacrifice oneself for science."
But **Krista** disagrees. 
She refuses to do penance. 
She refuses to sacrifice herself for science. 
Not now. 
Not ever.
