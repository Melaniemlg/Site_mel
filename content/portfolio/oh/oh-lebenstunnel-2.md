**Book 2: Chaos**     

**Krista** has lost her allies and her bearings. 
She is now alone. 
Alone in a world that seems both familiar and foreign. With one foot in each camp, she no longer knows who she really is. 
There is only one solution now: leave Germania. 
What lies beyond the city walls? 
Is the whole world under the aegis of the eugenic regime of which she is a pure product?
