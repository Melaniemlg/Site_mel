***What if the outcome of the Second World War was not what we knew?***     


**Book 1: Allegiance**     

200 years after Hitler’s victory, Germania is no longer a myth. 
The Aryan race so hoped for by the Führer dominates the world and all other ethnic groups have been eradicated from the planet.       
**Krista**, a young woman, works in a Lebensborn, the baby factory for the Aryan race. Raised in the mould of the pure race, 
she knows only this way of life, until one day she unwillingly follows a woman into the city’s sewers.       
What she discovers there shakes all her convictions and calls into question the very functioning of the world in which she lives...
