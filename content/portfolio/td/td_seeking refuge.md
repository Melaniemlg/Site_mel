Eleven-year-old Marianne is fortunate.
She is one of the first two hundred Jewish children in the heroic rescue operation known as the *Kindertransport*,
which arrived in London, England in December 1938.

Life in the new country seems strange. Marianne's few words of English and her attempts to become an ordinary English girl
are not enough to please her foster mother, who wanted a girl as a domestic servant. 
She deeply misses her family that she had to leave behind.

With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Marianne finds herself being evacuated to Wales. 
She is shuffled from one unsuitable home to another—but there is a surprise in store, and Marianne's courage
and resilience is finally rewarded...


*The Kindertransport, which ultimately saved almost 10,000 children from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia* 
*in the nine months preceding World War II, was a triumphant human effort.*
*Author Irene N. Watts was one of them, arriving on the second Kindertransport in December 1938 at the age of seven.*
