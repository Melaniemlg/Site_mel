***A powerful and colourful picture book showing the importance to ask for help when you are depressed.***


When Jehan smiled by day, the sun shone brightly over the wondrous city of Baghdad. 
When she smiled at night, the stars glittered and sparkled. 

Then one dull day, she could not find her smile, and gloom fell over the city. 
Jugglers and fire eaters tried to help, and failed. So did gifted artists from all over the world. 
Finally, a young man, with only a simple tool in his pouch, helps Jehan uncover the dazzling beauty that was always right before her eyes. 


*Infused with a gentle spirit and illustrated with arresting artwork, this is a tale rich with meaning for readers of any age.*
