Liliane Leila Juma was 16 years old when her family home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
was destroyed by rebel soldiers. 
In this gut-wrenching memoir, she gives an account of her life before and after her family was torn apart 
by the twin nightmares of civil war and invasion. Sincere and revealing, it gives a moving account of a young girl’s journey 
from a protected and secure family life, through a series of brutal conflicts that saw her father murdered and her former 
life utterly destroyed. 
*Red House* is a story of war and unspeakable loss. It is also the story of survival. Eventually, through the United Nations 
refugee program, Leila and her family were finally able to relocate to Canada.
