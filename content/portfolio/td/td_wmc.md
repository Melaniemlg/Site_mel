*Johannesburg, South Africa. 1976.*
**Zannele** is skipping school and secretly plotting against the apartheid government.
The police can't know. Her mother and sister can't know.

Her best friend, **Thabo**, schoolboy turned gang member, can tell she's up to something.
But he has troubles og this own—a deal gone wrong and some powerful enemies.

**Meena**, the daughter of an Indian shopkeeper, finds a packet of banned pamphlets.
They lead to a mysterious black girl with a secret, a dangerous gangster with expensive clothes,
and an engaging white boy who drives a battered red car.

Across the bridge, in the wealthy suburbs, **Jack** plans to spend his last days in Johannesburg 
before leaving for university, burning miles on his beat-up Mustang—until he meets a girl
with an unforgettable face from a black township on the edge of revolt—Soweto.
