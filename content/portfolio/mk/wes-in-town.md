***Wes in Town: a shoot in Angoulême.***     


When **Wes Anderson** came to Angoulême for the shooting of *The French Dispatch*,     
the director did not go unnoticed by the cartoonists!     
Angoulême, in addition to being a very visual city with its old cobbled streets, stone staircases and ramparts,      
is home to a whole host of cartoonists, animators, illustrators...      

*12 local authors, with a varied graphic universe, testify to this unique shooting.*
