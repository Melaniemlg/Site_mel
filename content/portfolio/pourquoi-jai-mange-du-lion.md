What could have driven the giraffe Ramona, a wise resident of the town zoo, to devour a lion?   
Were the acacia leaves not enough to satiate her?
"It was an accident!" she stammers to the sympathetic commissaire Pilli√®re.
"An assassination!" roared the widow of the dead beast in front of the implacable Deputy Dentu.
And what if it was ultimately a crime of passion?
Not bad. But that doesn't explain everything...


*In this short detective novel, love will not triumph any better than in Romeo and Juliet*.   
*But, as always, it is from the genius of the children that the light will shine.*
