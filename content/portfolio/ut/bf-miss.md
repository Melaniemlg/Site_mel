***A picture book not only for little girls who want to be grown-ups ahead of time, but also for their parents***


When she comes home from school, Lola spends hours in front of the mirror:
she stares at her reflection, she makes up her face, she practices walking like a model...
On Saturday, Auntie Christelle will drive her to the "Little Miss" contest.
On Saturday, she will be the prettiest!
But pretending to be a grown-up, when you are still a little girl, can bring complications...

*This story depicts with sensitivity and compassion the problem of little girls' hypersexualisation.*




*Family Kisses is a collection of books with endearing stories to liberate speech within the family.*
