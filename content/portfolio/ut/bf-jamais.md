***What did you never say to anyone?***


Their names are Madelyn, Agostina, David, or Mademba...
They come from all over the world. 
Like each of us, they have a dream, a secret of their own, an unspoken fear...
Throughout the pages, they reveal a part of their lives.

*The singular narration of this picture book, whose tone constantly oscillates between humour and emotion irresistibly carries us away.* 
*The minimalist illustrations allow the reader to feel in sympathy with the characters by focusing on what they have to say.* 
*It reminds us, that just like the characters, we all have something to share.*      


**Short-listed for Livralire 2021**





*Family Kisses is a collection of books with endearing stories to liberate speech within the family.*
