***The imaginary life of an unborn child***


*"The day should have started very easily.*   
*The shutters would have opened. We would have smelled the air from the balcony.*   
*We would have put on skirts and shorts... made chicory.*    
*We would have argued or kissed.*    
*But on June 9, 1944, a countdown had begun, somewhere..."*   

This story is about the life a little boy and his sister could have had if their father had
not died during the war. The book alternates between an imagined future and what really
happened to the father.       
        



*Family Kisses is a collection of books with endearing stories to liberate speech within the family.*
