***When facing our fears makes us stronger.***


Marilou is afraid of the night, of the dark, of everything!
Although, one morning, a question pops into her head about the mountain she sees through her window. 
The curious child asks her family:      
*“What is behind the mountain?”*      
But this question terrifies the adults who refuse to answer it. 
Her curiosity stronger than her apprehension, she takes her courage in both hands to discover the truth:   
behind the mountain hides a terrifying beast… *her own fear*.
