***A touching story about the questions adopted children have about their origins.***


Milo has run-away. 
He left behind a truth he does not want to admit: he was adopted.
In his heart, the storm is raging. A question keeps coming and going and tap his mind:
"Did they love me, those parents who abandoned me?".
In his flight forward, an unexpected encounter will help him understand the meaning of his own existence...
and slowly find the path to resilience.
