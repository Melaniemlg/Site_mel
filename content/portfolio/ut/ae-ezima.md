Ezima is the new girl in school and her voice with singing accents does not please everyone... 
Faced with the jugement of others, Sybille has to make a choice: defend her new friend, or ignore her in order to not be 
excluded from the group. 
When she finally finds the courage to assume their friendship, she has to put up with the mockery and harassment 
of her classmates. 
It is finally Ezima, thanks to her tenacity, her audacity, and the game of the three jumps, who will help Sybille to cross
the wall set up against them both, and will be able to create a place for herself in everyone's heart...
