***A caring book dealing with homosexuality.***


Feeling good about herself, Prune is a teenager who divides her life between school, her video club friends, 
her eco-friendly parents... and Axel. 
Until the day she discovers that the man she thought was her boyfriend is much more attracted to boys than girls. 
Understanding that she has lost a lover, but not a friend, Prune puts aside her self-esteem to help Axel accept
his homosexuality, despite the rejection of his parents and the homophobia surrounding them.
