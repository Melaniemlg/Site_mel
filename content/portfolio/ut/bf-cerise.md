Usually, Clotilde and her mother like to go for a walk, climb up the cherry tree, twirl in the middle of tall grass...
But today, if Clotilde clutches her mother's breast a little too tightly, it hurts her!    

*The idea behind this picture book is to propose an allegory.* 
*Alongside the mother's illness, the reader also follows the life of a cherry tree through the seasons.*
*The tree loses its leaves in autumn, just as the mother loses her hair.* 
*When spring comes, the mother will recover and the tree will bloom again.*       




*Family Kisses is a collection of books with endearing stories to liberate speech within the family.*
