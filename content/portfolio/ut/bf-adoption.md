***A picture book explaining birth under X and more widely adoption.***


One day, a classmate tells Bianca he does not want to play with her anymore, because she is sick.    
She is "bornunderex"!    
Upset, the child confides in her teacher, who, with the help of an illustrated primer, explains to children 
what it means to be born under X.   

*Through a visual treasure hunt, looking for the alphabet letters, this book explains that if children born under X do not*
*know what blood flows in their veins, they should not think of it as a disease!*
*For what counts above all is the love that is surrounding them.*         




*Family Kisses is a collection of books with endearing stories to liberate speech within the family.*
