***A funny and sensitive picture book to evoke the jealousy and tensions*** 
***that may come within siblings relationships.***


Here is a big sister who spends all her energy to be the strongest, the fastest, the nicest,
in the hope of becoming Mum and Dad's favourite.
But beware! Even if she is a little jealous, no one has the right to mess with her little brother.

*A universal subject that will speak to all brothers and sisters and their parents!*
