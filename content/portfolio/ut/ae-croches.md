Internationally renowned trumpet player, Malik Kadar flies to Cairo, his hometown, which he has not seen since his childhood. 
On this unexpected trip, the musician remembers the trumpet lessons he used to take in a room above a boxing gym.

The encounters he had in this unusual place, especially Issa, a young female boxer of his age who defied authority
to practice her sport, left a lasting impression on his life.
