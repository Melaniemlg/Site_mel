***The endearing story of a kamishibai storyteller and a child.***


In front of Shiro’s house lives a man who goes out everyday barefoot and with his bicycle. 
He is a kamishibai storyteller. From that moment, Shiro begins to listen faithfully to the man’s stories, 
without knowing that this encounter will change the course of his life.
As an adult, Shiro works and saves every penny to buy a nice suit, but he manages to listen to the old man when he can.    

But one day, the storyteller does not show up....
