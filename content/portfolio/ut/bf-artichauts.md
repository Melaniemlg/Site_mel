*"Tonight, we are eating artichokes.*   
*I’m worried, he doesn’t really like artichokes.*
*When I discovered Mommy was cooking them,* 
*I immediately thought this would make a fuss.*
*But I said nothing.*
*I sat quietly at my spot, on my mother’s left.*
*And I waited.*
*Maybe tonight nothing will happen."*   

Every night, Jeanne is afraid. She does not know if the man sitting at the dinner table
will be her father or the monster that hits her mother. Through her eyes, we see how
difficult this situation is for a child to grasp and how escape through imagination is a key
to overcoming these behaviours.    
        



*Family Kisses is a collection of books with endearing stories to liberate speech within the family.*
