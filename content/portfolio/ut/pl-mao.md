Mao wonders: how do you know when you are in love?
Determined to solve this mystery, he questions all members of his family.
"Being in love? It's like a flower growing in your heart..." says his mummy.
"Being in love? It's like flying away, very high..." replies his daddy.
With these answers, Mao is no further ahead...
Who will help recognize his own feelings and discover if he is really in love?
