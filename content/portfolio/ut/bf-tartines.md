***The story of a grandfather and grandson overcoming grief together.***


When Louis visits his grandfather Albert, they share the peace and quiet of the fragrant garden 
and rillettes on toast for snack. 
But they never talk about Louis' mother – Albert's daughter – who died in an accident, nor about their grief. 
Until the day Louis enters his grandfather's workshop, a room that is normally off limits to him.

*The moment they begin to share their feelings, grief and consolation become possible.*      




*Family Kisses is a collection of books with endearing stories to liberate speech within the family.*
