Lilou likes to snuggle up to her mommy and her big round belly. 
But for the past few days, her parents have been very sad. 
Is it because Lilou does not want to share her toys with her soon-to-be brother?
So, her grandmother Nanou is going to tell her a story. A real story: one of those you cannot change. 
The little brother who was in their mother's womb is dead. 
And when you are dead, it is for a lifetime.   

*Didier Jean and Zad have chosen to illustrate this story as soberly as possible thanks to a technique mixing gouache,* 
*pastel and black stone. Grey, black, white and red combine to accompany the subtle text of Sophie Helmlinger.*       




*Family Kisses is a collection of books with endearing stories to liberate speech within the family.*
